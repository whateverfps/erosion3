        <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
        <p><strong>APIs and Data Feeds:</strong> Use financial market data APIs (e.g., Bloomberg, Quandl, Alpha Vantage) to pull real-time data directly into your pricing model. Integrate these APIs into your spreadsheet or ERP system for automated updates.</p>
        <p><strong>Manual Updates:</strong> If API integration isn’t feasible, manually pull data from quarterly reports and update the model inputs in your Excel or other software as needed.</p>
        <p><strong>Tools for Integration:</strong> Utilize Excel Add-Ons (like Power Query) or Google Sheets functions (IMPORTXML or IMPORTHTML) for real-time data pulls from online sources.</p>
